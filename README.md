# VoiceMailAndroid
A voice dependent email system is an android solution which allows the user to send and receive emails without using any visual features, which means everything can be done by voice commands. This application is designed and engineered especially for people with visual disabilities. People who are visually impaired cannot access the normal type of email system so they have to depend on others, but this application will enable them to send and receive emails with voice commands and minimal action which can be carried out by them. This application is also useful for normal people who donâ€™t like to type so much, they can just use this application to compose a whole email by voice commands only. Project is a sort of aid to the visually impaired people by giving them access to the basic and mandatory features of the internet i.e. emails.
